A list of things i want to do in this project.
I do not want to be dependent on GitHub issues for tracking my tasks. At least not yet.
Once a TODO is complete, I will delete it from this list and record it in the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

- create script for getting and setting configs
- create script for updating linux on schedule
- create script for updating mac on schedule
